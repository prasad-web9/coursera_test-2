	    HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.
	    HTML describes the structure of a Web page. HTML consists of a series of elements. HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content.
	    It's not "written" in anything. It's a markup language. HTML is parsed by the browser which renders the webpage to display. It isn't a programming language.
	    HTML is used to create electronic documents (called pages) that are displayed on the World Wide Web. 
	    Each page contains a series of connections to other pages called hyperlinks.
	    Every web page you see on the Internet is written using one version of HTML code or another.
            The World Wide Web is composed primarily of HTML documents transmitted from web servers to web browsers using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
	    However, HTTP is used to serve images, sound, and other content, in addition to HTML. 
            To allow the web browser to know how to handle each document it receives, other information is transmitted along with the document.
	    This meta data usually includes the MIME type (e.g., text/html or application/xhtml+xml) and the character encoding (see Character encoding in HTML).
