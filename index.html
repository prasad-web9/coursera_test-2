	    HTML describes the structure of a Web page. HTML consists of a series of elements. HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content.
	    It's not "written" in anything. It's a markup language. HTML is parsed by the browser which renders the webpage to display. It isn't a programming language.
	    HTML is used to create electronic documents (called pages) that are displayed on the World Wide Web. 
	    Each page contains a series of connections to other pages called hyperlinks.
	    Every web page you see on the Internet is written using one version of HTML code or another.
            The World Wide Web is composed primarily of HTML documents transmitted from web servers to web browsers using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol.
	    However, HTTP is used to serve images, sound, and other content, in addition to HTML. 
            To allow the web browser to know how to handle each document it receives, other information is transmitted along with the document.
	    This meta data usually includes the MIME type and the character encoding (see Character encoding in HTML).

		Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.
		CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]
                CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.
		This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics,
		enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces 
		complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling
		the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
                Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods,
		such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules
		for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]
                The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element.
		This cascading priority scheme is predictable.
                The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998).
		The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.[5]
                In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.

        <p class="card-intro">JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[6] often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
		JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing,
		prototype-based object-orientation,and first-class functions.
		Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[8] JavaScript enables interactive web pages 
		and is an essential part of web applications.
		The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior,[9] and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
                As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.
		It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
		However, the language itself does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities,
		as the host environment (usually a web browser) provides those APIs.
                JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now embedded in some servers, usually via Node.js.
		They are also embedded in a variety of applications created with frameworks such as Electron and Cordova.
                Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and respective standard libraries,
		the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.</p>
