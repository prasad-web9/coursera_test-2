		They have a communal approach to the incubation of eggs and raising of young. 
		Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a "pecking order",
		with dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations. 
		Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established. 
		Adding hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.
		[20] When a rooster finds food, he may call other chickens to eat first. 
		He does this by clucking in a high pitch as well as picking up and dropping the food.
		This behaviour may also be observed in mother hens to call their chicks and encourage them to eat.
